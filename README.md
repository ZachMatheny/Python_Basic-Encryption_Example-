# Python_Basic-Encryption_Example-
The Python script showcases core cybersecurity principles through password hashing, encryption, and input validation. It prioritizes confidentiality by securely hashing passwords with bcrypt and encrypting messages using cryptography, safeguarding sensitive information from unauthorized access. Integrity is maintained through hashed password verification and encryption, ensuring data remains unaltered and accessible only to authorized parties. Availability is ensured by resilient password storage and robust encryption mechanisms, enhancing the availability of authentication services and protecting sensitive information. The script establishes a solid foundation for building secure applications and systems using established cryptographic libraries and potentially including input validation routines.
